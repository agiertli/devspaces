== Lab 2 - Customizing Kamelets

=== Intro

Red Hat ships many kamelets with the camel-k operator out of the box:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc project userX-dev
oc get kamelet | wc -l
      202
----

`Kamelets` are *not as flexible* as the camel components which they are
based on. If the underlying camel component supports hundreds of
parameters, the corresponding kamelet only expose a couple, chances are,
the out of the box kamelet will not be directly useful at your customer
or for your use case.

People often don’t realize that `kamelet` can, and even should be,
*extended and customized*. This is how you can ge the best experience
out of using them - by tailoring them precisely for your particular use
case. And *this is what we are going to do in the Lab 2.*

`Kamelets` can be `Sources` or `Sinks` and are connected throught
`KameletBindings`

=== Task

Most times the integration with any Artemis broker needs *authenticated
users and one-way ssl enforced*. - *The out of the box kamelet doesn’t
support neither authentication nor ssl*

*1. Support basic authentication against Artemis broker*

* Inspect the out of the box kamelet to understand its internal
mechanics:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc project userN-dev
cd basic-auth
oc get kamelet jms-amqp-10-sink -o yaml | oc neat > custom-sink-kamelet.yaml
----

* Inspect the
https://github.com/apache/qpid-jms/blob/main/qpid-jms-client/src/main/java/org/apache/qpid/jms/JmsConnectionFactory.java[ConnectionFactory
constructor] and see whether there is a constructor suitable for our
purposes. Consider adding new `username` and `password` kamelet
properties and also new ConnectionFactory constructor parameters
* camel-k will cleverly ``guess'' which ConnectionFactory constructor to
call based on the number and types of the parameters. `Order matters(!)`
* After applying the changes to the kamelet yaml file, make sure to
alter these two attributes as well:
** `namespace: userN-dev`
** `name: custom-jms-amqp-10-sink`
* Apply the custom kamelet in your namespace, i.e. 
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f custom-sink-kamelet.yaml
----
* Test your kamelet by changing `ArtemisIntegration.java` to connect to
the Artemis Broker running on OCP
** You can find out the Broker service url like this:
`$ oc get svc -n tooling | grep artemis-no-ssl`
** TIP: Correct syntax to call services outside of current namespace is
`<service>.<pod_namespace>.svc.cluster.local`
** Use following credentials to connect, simply pass them as kamelet
endpoint parameters:
*** `username: admin`
*** `password: password1!`
* Run the integration - notice, we are now running the integration on a
cluster (hence kamel cli) :
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kamel run ArtemisIntegration.java
----

* If everything went well, you should similar output in the logs in the
started pod in your namespace:
+
....
2022-12-01 21:29:52,693 INFO  [org.apa.qpi.jms.JmsConnection] (AmqpProvider :(1556):[amqp://rhte-artemis-no-ssl-0-svc.tooling.svc.cluster.local:5672]) Connection ID:ef32e5da-b4a2-4172-bae8-50b0c03b216a:1556 connected to server: amqp://rhte-artemis-no-ssl-0-svc.tooling.svc.cluster.local:5672   
....

*2. Add one-way ssl*

When you check the `dependencies` section of the `jms-amqp-10-sink`
kamelet, you will notice that it’s based on the QPID client. QPID allows
to specify most of the client properties directly inside the Connection
URI, see
https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-jms-1.7.0/docs/index.html[official
documentation] for more details. At the very least, we need to supply
the URL as follows:

`amqps://host:port?transport.trustStoreLocation=/path/to/client/truststore&transport.trustStorePassword=truststorePassword!&transport.verifyHost=false`

Unfortunately it’s not so straightforward to pass this value in a
camel-k integration. Any query parameter inside remoteURI will be
treated as a kamelet property (and not a remoteURI query parameter).

In our case it would mean that `truststorePassword` would not be passed
to the underlying ConnectionFactory (you are free to try this out;)).

*Potential solution* could be to use
https://camel.apache.org/manual/faq/how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[RAW]
feature of Camel and pass our remoteURI value as RAW(remoteURI).
Unfortunately RAW
https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets/issues/1200[doesn’t seem to
work] in the camel-k 1.8 operator version.

So we need to get a bit more creative…:

* Add three more Kamelet parameters:
** verifyHost (type: string, default:false)
** trustStoreLocation (type:string)
** trustStorePassword (type:string)
* Change the way `remoteURI` is defined in Kamelet definition:

```
   - key: remoteURI
   value: '{{remoteURI}}?transport.trustStoreLocation={{trustStoreLocation}}&transport.trustStorePassword={{trustStorePassword}}&transport.verifyHost={{verifyHost}}'
```

By defining the remoteURI query parameters directly in the Kamelet
definition, we will bypass camel property parser which was causing the
`trustStorePassword` param to ``be lost''.

Do not forget you need to *inject a client truststore* into the
integration pod:

* See file `client.ts` in your user git repository. +
* Create a secret based on the contents of this file.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd ssl
oc create secret generic my-artemis-secret --from-file=client.ts
----
* `kamel` binary allows us to reference a secret and mount it to a
specified location - mount it somewhere under `/etc`
+
....
--resource secret:secretName@/where/you/want/to/mount/it

See [documentation](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.10.x/configuration/runtime-resources.html) for more details.
....

Update your `ArtemisIntegration.java`: - URI scheme is now `amqps` (as
opposed amqp) - Get the new _ssl_ service name from `tooling` namespace
- beware, the port is also different! - trustStorePassword is
`password1!` - trustStoreLocation should match whatever you passed via
`kamel run --resource ..`

Run your integration:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kamel run --resource secret:my-artemis-secret@/etc/ssl/jms-sink ArtemisIntegration.java
----

=== Summary

In this lab we focused on customizing the Kamelets. This is a
fundamental feature of the Kamelets and it allows you to unlock the full
potential of them. More often than not you will encounter requirements
at your own customers which will make out of the box Kamelets not
suitable. You can either raise an RFE and wait months for it to be
delivered or fix it yourself - and now you should know how.
