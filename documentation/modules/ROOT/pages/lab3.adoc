== Lab 3 - KameletBinding evolution

=== Intro

So far we have been developing our integrations in Java. There are other
DSL out there (such as groovy, javascript, and even yaml) but
development of such Integrations is still a fairly technical task and it
requires camel knowledge. However with well designed (reusable,
configurable) `Kamelets` itâ€™s possible to deploy an integration using a
slightly different way - by utilizing `KameletBinding`.

As the name suggests, itâ€™s a OpenShift custom resource which allows you
to bind source/sink kamelets (or camel components) in a declarative way.
This opens new possibilities for camel-k. *KameletBindings* enable
non-camel experts to deploy and configure Integrations.

This doesnâ€™t mean usage of camel-k doesnâ€™t require deep technical and
integration knowledge - somebody _still_ has to develop and maintain the
Kamelets, but once that is done, the adoption of *KameletBindings*
(especially when combined with a templating engine such as `helm`) will
be very straightfoward.

It has another advantage - the fact itâ€™s a OpenShift CR means we donâ€™t
have to deal with `kamel cli` anymore to run an integration. We can
directly apply the file on OpenShift and it will result into running
Integration. This also greatly fits into todayâ€™s GitOps ways of working.

=== Task

In this lab we will: - Turn our Java based integration into a Kamelet
Binding. - Use `helm` to generate multiple Kamelet Bindings with ease. -
Generate N bindings (where N is number of lab users) to generate messages
for every user in this lab. - Add one more binding which will simply
read all the messages you as a user received.

The output of the helm chart should produce this:

The actual helm templates were already developed for you.

While helm and KameletBindings go really well together - because itâ€™s
really easy to template the bindings, Kamelets also heavily depend on
using `{{ camel-k-placeholders }}` which conflicts with
`{{ helm-placeholders }}`, so figuring out the syntax is a major PITA.

*1. Create Secrets*

* Letâ€™s start by secret provisioning. If you finished previous lab, you
should already have secret containing `client.ts` available in
`userN-dev` namespace. If not, make sure to create it now, i.e.:


[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc project userN-dev &&
cd utils &&
oc create secret generic client-truststore --from-file=client.ts
----

* Add one more secret - previously, our Java integration contained some
hardcoded values with sensitive information (such as broker
credentials). This is of course not feasible in beyond demo scenario!
Letâ€™s create _another_ secret which will contain:
** broker username (admin)
** broker password (password1!)
** broker connection url
(amqps://rhte-artemis-one-way-ssl-0-svc.tooling.svc.cluster.local:5673)
** truststore password (password1!)
+
*You can use `utils/create-secrets.sh` and `utils/artemis-secret.yaml`
to assist with this task.*
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
## Change the values in create-secrets.sh
 ./create-secrets.sh
----

*2. Helm + Kamel = ðŸ’ª*

* Explore `charts/templates` - thatâ€™s where all the magic happens. We
are defining a few custom Kamelets, but most importantly we are
templating the creation of Kamelet Bindings.
** Understand how _binary_ (vs _normal_) secrets are handled.
** We are also using
https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.8.x/traits/traits.html[traits] which
is a camel-k feature which allows us to enable additional super powers
on top of our integrations. Usage of the `Container` trait is almost
inevitable in OCP environment.
** If you study `kamelet-bindings.yaml` you will notice it is completely
generic and supports _any_ two Kamelets and _any_ properties.

*** This is a very powerful concept as you can use this as a base template
to define integrations for many different systems. However, if this was
a real-world scenario, this helm chart wouldnâ€™t be so useful without the
accompanying documentation. The only way how to make the consumption of
such helm chart easy, is to make sure its consumers can focus on just
supplying helm values, and not to deal with the underlying templates
(which are still fairly complex and technical).
+
* Change `dev/values.yaml` in such a way that will create the
appropriate bindings as per the Helm Diagram screenshot. There are
scripts ready for you in `utils` to test the helm chart.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc delete kamelet custom-jms-amqp-10-sink &&
./install.sh
----
+
The result should look similar to this:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc get klb -n userN-dev
NAME                           PHASE   REPLICAS
rhte-camelk.user1.to.user2   Ready   1
rhte-camelk.user1.to.user3   Ready   1
rhte-camelk.user1.to.user4   Ready   1
rhte-camelk.user1.to.user5   Ready   1
rhte-camelk.user1.to.user6   Ready   1
rhte-camelk.user1.to.user7   Ready   1
rhte-camelk.user1.to.log      Ready   1
----


The number of `userN.to.userM` bindings can differ based on the
number of actual users present in the lab. Donâ€™t forget to check the
integration logs to make sure there are no errors. You can use
`kamel get` and `kamel log`, or plain `oc`.

=== Summary

We showcased how `helm` can be easily used to generate KameletBindings.
This combination allow easier consumption of camel-k styled integration,
as all it requires is a documentation of `helm` value files. We also
showed how to inject configuration and sensitive data into the bindings
and also scratched the surface on the `traits`.
