== Lab 1 - Local development

=== Intro

`camel-k` is a cloud native integration framework: - builds on top of
camel, quarkus and targets Cloud (kubernetes, OpenShift) as its target
runtime. - comes with `kamel` cli tool which enables developer to deploy
integration onto cloud. By default, `kamel` requires cloud access.

But what if you are in early stages of development and you just want to
test your integration locally?

[quote]
What if the components you want to integrate with, are not yet
available in the cloud platform?

There are two options how to start developing camel-k integration
locally without depending on cloud access:

* kamel local
** https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.10.x/running/local.html
* camel/jbang
** https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-jbang.html

=== Task

*0. Log into your online IDE powered by Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*

URL can be retrieved by following instructions in xref:01-setup.adoc[Setup chapter] .
Workspace has been already pre-created for you and you simply need to open it - the first time you do it might take up to 1 minute.

.Dev Spaces Dashboard

The next useful thing is to access Dev Spaces terminal, which immediatelly gets you access to OpenShift 4 Cluster.

You will be already logged into the OpenShift with access to various namespaces useful for the following lab work.

*1. Initialize and run the hello world integration*

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
camel init ArtemisIntegration.java
----
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
camel run ArtemisIntegration.java
----

* You should see similar output in the console log

2022-11-29 20:37:28.693  INFO 72000 --- [ - timer://java] ArtemisIntegration.java:14               : Hello Camel from java
----

Throughout this lab, we will be developing a very *simple integration
which will talk to an Artemis broker*.

Inside your workspace IDE, there is already artemis container up and
running with following characteristics:

 - `AMQ_USER=admin`
 - `AMQ_PASSWORD=password1!`
 - Access to the artemis pod with dev spaces is
done using `artemis-amqp-service`.

*2. Connect `ArtemisIntegration` to Artemis*

Next step is to alter our `ArtemisIntegration.java` to send generated
messages to our broker.

There are multiple options how to do this: - `camel-amqp` component -
`camel-jms` with `qpid` library on the classpath.

Trouble is, `camel-amqp` is not yet fully supported at the time of
writing this lab (12/2022) and `camel-jms` forces you to set up a
ConnectionFactory bean manually, via code.

While this is possible in camel-k, it doesn’t create the best possible
developer experience. Generally speaking, when working with (custom)
beans is something which your integration heavily relies on, it should
prompt you to re-think the design and decide, whether Camel on Quarkus
wouldn’t be more suitable option as it offers the _most_ flexibility.
There is no _single_ right answer, single ConnectionFactory bean
certainly doesn’t disqualify usage of camel-k, but it’s good to be aware
of all the options.

Instead of implementing our custom ConnectionFactory bean, we will be
using a `Kamelet`. Kamelets are additional layers of abstraction of
camel components. They are hiding the camel component complexity and
exposing strict interface to its consumers. Their consumption doesn’t
require deep camel knowledge - only the knowledge of the interface
exposed by the particular Kamelet. They are also built for cloud native
deployment, so the transition from locally running route using `camel`
to fully fledged `camel-k` integration will be straightforward.

*Finish the Lab 1 by following steps below:*

* Locate amqp compatible kamelet :

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
camel catalog kamelet | grep amqp
----

* Familiarize yourself with the *AMQP Sink Kamelet*:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
camel doc jms-amqp-10-sink
----

* Change the `ArtemisIntegration.java` as follows:
** remove `;` after the `log` command and add another step in the route
using `to` DSL
** Use following kamelet endpoint syntax:
*** `kamelet:<kamelet-name>?kameletOption=kameletValue`. Use following
values:
*** destination type - `topic`
*** destination name - `userN-dev` (replace `N` with appropriate number)
*** remoteURI - `amqp://artemis-amqp-service:5672`
* Run the `ArtemisIntegration.java` again, you should see following in
the logs:

=== Summary

* `kamel local` or `camel` cli tools allow developers to work on the
integrations locally which can be useful in early stages of development.
* If your integration depends on 3rd party services (be it AMQ Broker,
Kafka cluster, etc) you could mock those locally by using `podman` or
`docker`. Engineering is working to improve the local development
experience, especially the mocking part.
* `Kamelets` can be extremely useful if you want to hide complexity of
the underlying camel components and enable non-camel developers to
integrate with services easily.
