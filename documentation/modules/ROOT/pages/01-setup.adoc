include::_attributes.adoc[]

The lab setup is backed by ArgoCD - there is single parent app in the `tooling` namespace which deploys following services:

 - AMQ 7
 - camelk
 - gitea
 - nexus
 - sealed secrets

You, as a user, have _view_ access to `tooling` namespace, which allows you to get all the information - such as connection URLs for AMQ, camel-k operator logs for troubleshooting, etc.

Final Argo Application, called `namespaces` configures user namespaces and permission. Each user (or team) have following namespaces created with admin permissions:
 - userN-dev
 - userN-prod
