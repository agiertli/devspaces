== Publish Services to Kubernetes

Welcome to Cloud Native Integration with camel-k lab. We are excited to have you. The focus of this lab is to share field experience from real, production, camel-k deployment. We will not be focusing on the creation of the complex camel integration. Instead, we will be focusing on everything else - building, deploying, testing, troubleshooting and customizing. The aim is to cover a full lifecycle of developing a camel-k application. From the initial bootstrapping all the way to production deployment. Let's get down to it, and most importantly, let's have some fun.
